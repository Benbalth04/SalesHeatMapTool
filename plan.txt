### Want to only focus on back-end, front end can wait until moving over to Shopify Polaris

#### Overall Plan 
1- Have three pythons scripts (sales processing, geoson processing and map generation)
2- Move over to Javascript's leaflet instead of Python's folium (more customisable)
3- Create more map customisation ability ((e.g. what color maps, any marker locations ?, search bar, legends, expand, date ranges))
4- Setup event handlers for clicking on choropleths - allowing the zoom feature to be created
5- Setup firebase authentification and database (for basic preferences and previous marker locations) 

#### Current Steps
1- Finalise and test that map_proccessor.py produces the same map file
2- Write some tests as well as error code messages for the python scripts
